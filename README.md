# Neo4j Community Center

The Neo4j Community Center is an [awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) 
turned into a graph and presented as a website.

## Design

Target: a website featuring data + code + people

Guidance:

1. "The way it begins is usually the way it ends" > "Move fast and break things"
2. overtly graphy > graph powered
3. graph thinking > neo4j implementation
4. diverge/converge cycles > iteration on the same

Inspiration:

- Kaggle as a community based on data
- Github as a community based around code
- both as communities of.. people :)
