# Neo4j CC Libraries

- `access/` for access to remote data sources
- `model/` for pure model definitions
- `feature/` for complex, application-specific presentational components
- `ui/` for generic, shared presentational components
- `util/` for pure functional code
- `nest/` for nest modules used by apps/api

## Scaffolding

Add a library collection:

```sh
mkdir libs/{collection-name}

# For example, to create a `model` library collection
mkdir libs/model
```
