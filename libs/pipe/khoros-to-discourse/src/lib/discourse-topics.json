    "raw": "I have to believe I MUST be doing something wrong. I am a database expert by the way, having worked in engineering and consulting at database companies for 24 years, and I'm a language expert in over 13 languages. So I know what I am doing.\n\nBut when I run a simple benchmark for simple inserts into an ODBMS or RDBMS, or just about any other DBMS, records with two columns (or properties) I consistently get between 10,000 up to 30,000 tps. But with Neo4j I get an appalling 11 tps. I was getting over 10,000 TPS 23 years ago with ObjectStore, so I cannot understand why when I follow documentation I only get 11 TPS with Neo4j? Can someone point out what I am doing incorrectly?\n\nI have to be doing something terribly wrong. This same hardware (64 GB RAM, 2 TB NVMe, 10 Gbps Eth) gets bleeding edge performance with any other database. I have assigned 16 GB to the database. And I am simply trying to insert a few dozen records, upwards of a few thousand. So this is a VERY SMALL database, no reason to be slow. And I am not setting up ANY relationships, only inserting nodes.\n\nCan someone explain to me what I could possibly be doing wrong in the code below that would result in this sort of performance? I am literally copying the code out of the golang driver \"benchmark\" (for the most part).\n\n```\n\tctx := context.Background()\n\n\t// create an auth token...\n\tneo4jAuthToken := getNeoAuthToken(neo4jUsername, neo4jPassword, neo4jRealm)\n\n\t// create a driver...\n\tdriver, err := neo4j.NewDriverWithContext(neo4jUri, neo4jAuthToken)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\tdefer driver.Close(ctx)\n\n\tif err := driver.VerifyConnectivity(ctx); err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"failed to verify connection: %s\", err)\n\t}\n\n\t// create the session configuration...\n\tconfig := neo4j.SessionConfig{\n\t\tAccessMode: neo4j.AccessModeWrite,\n\t}\n\n\tcount := 100\n\tstart := time.Now()\n\tfor i := 0; i < count; i++ {\n\t\tsession := driver.NewSession(ctx, config)\n\t\tdefer session.Close(ctx)\n\n\t\tname := fmt.Sprintf(\"jim_%d\", i)\n\t\t_, err = session.Run(ctx, `CREATE (n:Account {name: $name, hash: $hash}) RETURN n`,\n\t\t\tmap[string]interface{}{\n\t\t\t\t\"name\": name,\n\t\t\t\t\"hash\": hash(name),\n\t\t\t})\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\tlog.Fatal(err)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\telapsed := time.Since(start).Milliseconds()\n\trate := float64(count) * 1000 / float64(elapsed)\n\tfmt.Println(\"Time to load: \" + strconv.Itoa(int(elapsed)))\n\tfmt.Println(\"Rate in load: \" + fmt.Sprintf(\"%f\", rate))\n```\n\n\\`\\`",
