The trek routes are generally not documented and you need to rely on local guides or make sure you have someone who’s covered the route before. These trek routes pass by tiny isolated villages that act as a point to recharge supplies as well as a marker for the route. The same destination can sometimes be reached via different routes depending on the abilities (rock climbing), mode of transport (by foot,cycle,SUV) and also the season. A graph would be an ideal way to represent this data and help find routes to various destinations based on your preferences.","author":{"name":"Shantaram Waingankar","email":null},"industries":[],"categories":[{"name":"Sports and Recreation"}],"use_cases":[{"name":"Sports and Recreation"}],"id":"trek-amp-mountaineering-routing"},

The Tokyo Metro Subway System forms part of the extensive rapid transit system within the Tokyo area of Japan. As of 2013, the Tokyo subway system, consisting of Tokyo Metro and Toei lines, consists of 290 stations and 13 lines. Over 8 million passengers ride through the system daily. This represents only 22% of Tokyo’s 40 million daily rail passengers. A subway system is organized into multiple stations and multiple rail lines, with multiple stations served by multiple rail lines. Each rail line thus contains a link to one or more of its stations within the subway system, and multiple rail lines may share the same stations. This domain thus lends itself to be modeled as a graph. Each station and rail line can also have a distinct set of attributes and parameters which also lends itself well with the property graph model. A rail line can have one or more stations. A station can be served by one or more rail lines. This is not a complete solution for all rail transport or transport use cases but provides a good starting point.","author":{"name":"Josh Kunken","email":null},"industries":[],"categories":[],"use_cases":[],"id":"representing-the-tokyo-metro-subway-system-in-neo4j"},

A few of us at Neo felt strongly that these domains were very graphy in nature. We wanted to see if our intuition was right (we love the Diaspora project and extend our help to you) and so with the help of Cypher, created a mini version of each of the domains that Sarah described.","author":{"name":"Neo4j","email":null},"industries":[],"categories":[{"name":"Pop Culture"}],"use_cases":[{"name":"Pop Culture"}],"id":"tv-show-graph"},

It uses data from Geoptima, an application for collecting passive and active events on mobile devices running on cellular networks. The event logs can be used to analyze the subscriber's experience of the mobile network and help track performance problems. For example, does iPhone 4 perform better or worse than iPhone 5 when accessing Facebook in a specific region of the network?

{"title":"AML fraud detection","url":"http://neo4j.com/graphgist/github-sark7%2FAML-example%2F%2Fother%2FAML-example.adoc/","slug":"aml-fraud-detection","summary":"Introduction to Problem\r\n\r\nThe fight against fraud and AML (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering) often hits a ‘brick wall’ when encountering labyrinthian international, corporate structures. Even well-known brands such as Google and Starbucks, use controversial, though currently accepted, international structures to optimize capital flows and to reduce tax liabilities, for instance the so-called Double Irish or Dutch Sandwich (http://www.w3schools.com/html/).\r\n\r\nDue to this complexity, increasingly it is a challenge for regulators to determine whether a particular construction, and associated transactions, are acceptable or questionable. A part of the problem is that the tools for tracking capital flows between structures are typically linear, following paths on a static process diagram. When transactions are circular, or involve more than several ‘hops’, the linear method breaks down.\r\n\r\nOriginal blog post: http://sctr7.com/2014/10/10/anti-money-laundering-aml-the-network-graph-analytics-approach/\r\n\r\nExplanation of Scenario\r\n\r\nThe reality of global conglomerates is that they are typically less a top-down organization, and more a complex, interconnected network of cross-ownership, control, and co-investment. Auditing such labyrinthian beasts is enough to bring a grown auditor to tears. This is where network ‘graph analytics’ can be invaluable. By tracking complex structures as native networks, fraud and AML investigators can simplify the process of understanding and tracing complex transactions.\r\n\r\nTypical Scenario\r\n\r\nAs an example, Samsung Group (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung), the South Korean multinational conglomerate, is famously known for the complexity of its interconnected cross-ownership structure (http://qz.com/223755/samsungs-bizarre-byzantine-ownership-structure-in-one-incredibly-convoluted-chart/). Samsung has run into antitrust, bribery (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung#Controversies), tax evasion, and embezzlement (http://www.economist.com/news/business/21620195-succession-looms-korean-conglomerate-much-has-change-waiting-wings) accusations and scandals. A difficulty facing regulators is the complexity of the partial ownership structures involved.\r\n\r\nAs per a recent Economist article attempting to explain the situation (http://www.economist.com/news/business/21620195-succession-looms-korean-conglomerate-much-has-change-waiting-wings), “for example, the group’s holding company, which has just changed its name from Samsung Everland to Cheil Industries, owns 19.3% of Samsung Life, which owns 34.4% of Samsung Card, which owns 5% of Cheil.… This corporate hairball has let the Lees exert control over the group with a stake of less than 2%.”","author":{"name":"sark7","email":""},"industries":[{"name":"Finance"}],"categories":[{"name":"Fraud Detection"},{"name":"Finance"}],"use_cases":[{"name":"Fraud Detection"}],"id":"aml-fraud-detection"},

For instance, target or gene classification, or keyword synonims or keyword hierarchy (e.g. medicinal chemistry is part of chemistry).\r\n\r\nThe proposed network lets scientists handle journals, papers, authors and keywords they read, and suggests articles for reading and can be used to filter upcoming publications and make reading recommendations.

A classic example of a trophic cascade is the re-introduction of wolves into Yellowstone in 1995 after a 70-year hiatus. This triggered a massive trophic cascade, involving different predators, prey, plants and even physical landscape. Wolf reintroduction may represent an effective method for passively restoring ecosystems. This GraphGist explores the Wolf’s role in the ecosystem of Yellowstone.
